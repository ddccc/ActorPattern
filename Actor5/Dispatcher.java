public abstract class Dispatcher extends Job {
    /**
       An instance of a subclass is a job that decides whether an alert 
       is ignored or not.  The mechanism is doing a limited number of 
       resolutions in a connection graph theorem prover - which lives in the 
       fol package.

       When the alert is honored an action, pre-specified in the alert,
       will be launched as another job.

       {Note: In a more advanced approach the alert would not contain a 
       pre-specified action but instead just a goal to be achieved.  
       A planning operation would be required to construct the sequence 
       of actions to be subsequently executed.}

       Making launch decisions in terms of predicate calculus reasoning is 
       essentially different from what goes on in the sensory realm where 
       low level states are observed by monitors, which can impact states 
       in turn, or - after data enrichments - can produce alerts.

       Instances of subclasses are created in ActorBase by 
       dispatchAlert(Alert alert)
