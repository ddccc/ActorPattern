    /**
       An instance of a subclass of Dispatcher is a job that decides 
       whether an alert is ignored or not.  The mechanism available is 
       doing a limited number of resolutions in a connection graph 
       theorem prover - which lives in the fol package.

       When the condition in the dispatcher is honored an action,
       pre-specified in the dispatcher, will be launched as another
       job.

       {Note: In a more advanced approach the alert would not contain a 
       pre-specified action but instead just a goal to be achieved.  
       A planning operation would be required to construct the sequence 
       of actions to be subsequently executed.}

       Making launch decisions in terms of predicate calculus reasoning is 
       essentially different from what goes on in the sensory realm where 
       low level states are observed by monitors, which can impact states 
       in turn, or - after data enrichments - can produce alerts.

       Instances of subclasses are created in ActorBase by 
       dispatchAlert(Alert alert)
